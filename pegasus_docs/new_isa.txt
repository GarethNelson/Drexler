     8 bits hardware specific type
       0 UART
     8 bits flags
       7 hardware write 8-bit  - the underlying hardware supports 8-bit write
       6 hardware read 8-bit   - the underlying hardware supports 8-bit read
       5 hardware write 32-bit - the underlying hardware supports 32-bit write
       4 hardware read 32-bit  - the underlying hardware supports 32-bit read
       3 hardware can write (does not imply permission)
       2 hardware can read (does not imply permission)
       1 write permission
       0 read permission
     8 bits physical channel ID

memory bank map register (8 per task - maps virtual to physical banks)

       2 write enabled
       1 read enabled
       0 bank present
     8 bits physical bank

global exception register:
     8 bits exception ID (set only when exception occurs and not automatically cleared to 0 after)
     8 bits physical memory bank ID for exception handler
    16 bits memory offset for exception handler

global syscall register:
     8 bits syscall ID (set by calling task)
     8 bits physical memory bank ID for syscall handler

     8 bits global flags
       7 halted - set high when halted for the debugger
       6 exception - set high until cleared by exception handler
       5 exception handler set - if 0, exceptions will cause a halt
       4 syscall handler set - if 0, syscalls will cause exceptions
       3 unused
       2 unused
       1 unused

GPRs split up:
  GPR0H (H for High) is the highest 16 bits in GPR0
  GPR0L is the lowest 16 bits
  GPR0A is the first 8 bit byte
  GPR0B is the second 8 bit byte
  GPR0C is the third 8 bit byte
  GPR0D is the fourth 8 bit byte



SETREG    $r $v
  $r may be ANY register including other task registers (if privileged)
SETMEMREL $m $v
USEBANK $b
  essentially SETREG BANK $v
SETMEMABS $b $m $v
  turned into USEBANK
SYSRET
COPYBANK $a $b $m

branch predicates
  only one immediate value allowed
  must compare between 2 registers or between register and immediate


JMP $m
JMPFAR is turned into USEBANK
